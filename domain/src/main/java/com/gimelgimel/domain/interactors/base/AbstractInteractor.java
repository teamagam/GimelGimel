 * Created by dmilicic on 8/4/15.
 * <p/>
 * This abstract class implements some common methods for all interactors. Cancelling an interactor, check if its running
 * and finishing an interactor has mostly the same code throughout so that is why this class was created. Field methods
 * are declared volatile as we might use these methods from different threads (mainly from UI).
 * <p/>
 * For example, when an activity is getting destroyed then we should probably cancel an interactor
 * but the request will come from the UI thread unless the request was specifically assigned to a background thread.
